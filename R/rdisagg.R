#' Generate random disaggregates
#'
#' Creates a random sample of disaggregates based on the information provided.
#' The aggregate and the shares are sampled independently. The distribution
#' from which to sample is determined internally based on the information
#' provided by the user.
#'
#' @param n sample size
#' @param mean_0 the best guess of the aggregate
#' @param sd_0 the standard deviation of the aggregate
#' @param min the lower boundary
#' @param max the upper boundary
#' @param shares best guesses for the shares (need to sum to one unless they contain NA's). See `?rshares`
#' @param sds standard deviations of the shares (can contain NA). Set to NULL (default) if none available.
